## 📷 LightShooterJS
This program is a very basic project of web crawling.

## ❓ How it works?
It access random links generated by itself and try to scrape the screenshot and save it.
I tested it crawling more than 4k images and prnt.sc did not blocked me, but, if they block you,
you can just use a free VPN.

`Note:` you must have Node.js installed to be able to run it. You can download and install it
via Node.js website [here](https://nodejs.org/).
